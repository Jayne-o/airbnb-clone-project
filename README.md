#Technology Stack
PostgresSQL - PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.
Python: Python is a versatile programming language used in various fields, including web development, data science, machine learning, and automation. It's known for its readability, ease of learning, and large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. 
API - Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and specifications that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other

#API Security
1. Secure Authentication and Authorization:
Authentication: Verify the identity of users and systems accessing the API using strong mechanisms like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or API keys, ensuring only legitimate requests are processed.
Authorization: Define and enforce access controls and permissions to restrict what authenticated users can do, adhering to the principle of least privilege, allowing users to access only necessary data and functionality.
Token-based authentication: Use token-based authentication methods like JWTs to enable stateless authentication, reducing server load and improving scalability. 
2. Encryption:
HTTPS: Encrypt data in transit between the app and API server using HTTPS (TLS/SSL) to prevent eavesdropping and data interception, safeguarding user data and preventing Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
Data at rest: Encrypt sensitive data stored on the server side using strong encryption algorithms like AES-256 to prevent unauthorized access if the data is compromised. 
3. Input Validation:
Sanitize and validate inputs: Implement strict input validation to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), ensuring that malicious data cannot be executed.
Parameterized queries or ORM: Use parameterized queries or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries for database operations to avoid SQL injection attacks. 
4. Rate Limiting:
Prevent abuse and DoS attacks: Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a given timeframe, preventing abuse and mitigating denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. 
5. Logging and Monitoring:
Monitor API activity: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents in real time, identifying potential security incidents and unusual activity patterns.
Real-time SIEM monitoring: Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to analyze logs in real-time and detect potential security threats. 
6. Vulnerability Management and Testing:
Regular security audits: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the API.
Automated scanning tools: Use automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify common security issues and integrate them into your development pipeline.
Dynamic and Static Application Security Testing (DAST and SAST): Integrate DAST and SAST into your testing strategy to dynamically and statically assess your APIs for vulnerabilities. 
7. Secure API Endpoints:
Minimize exposure: Avoid exposing sensitive API endpoints and minimize the amount of data returned in API responses to reduce the attack surface.
Use API gateways: Consider using an API gateway to centralize security policies, handle authentication and authorization, and provide features like rate limiting and request filtering. 
8. Secure Coding Practices:
Follow secure coding standards: Adhere to secure coding standards like those recommended by OWASP to minimize common coding vulnerabilities.
Proper error handling: Handle errors appropriately and avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages.
Secrets management: Store API keys and other secrets securely using environment variables or secret management tools, avoiding hardcoded secrets. 
9. Continuous API Discovery:
Maintain API inventory: Implement continuous API discovery to identify and document all APIs in use, including shadow or zombie APIs, ensuring they are protected.
